        <p>How to Make Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies Step-By-Step
            Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make chocolate chip cookies from-scratch:
            
            Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.
            Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.

            How Long to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies
            In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the cool).</p>
