    <p>

1 pound breakfast sausage, hot, sage or regular
3 cups milk

3 tbls of regular flour
2 tbls butter
salt and pepper to taste (needs quite a bit of salt)
How to make sausage gravy! Its easy and really good! If you have some leftover gravy just put it in a pan and warm up with some more milk in it to get it thinned out again and its just as good as the first time.
