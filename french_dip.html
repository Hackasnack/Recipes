    <p>3 lb 1 chuck roast
        kosher salt, to taste
        freshly ground black pepper, to taste
        1 tablespoon olive oil
        1 medium yellow onion, sliced
        3 cloves garlic
        4 cups beef stock
        1 tablespoon soy sauce
        2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
        8 French rolls
        4 tablespoons 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, room temperature
        </p>

        <p>
            On a cutting board, pat the chuck roast dry with paper towels. Season on all sides with salt and pepper.
Set the Instant Pot to sauté and add the olive oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chuck roast and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chuck roast and set aside.
Add the onion to the Instant Pot and cook, stirring often, until softened and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, about 1 minute.
Add the beef broth and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the soy sauce and rosemary and place the chuck roast on top. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour. Let the pressure naturally release.
Transfer the chuck roast to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks.
Meanwhile, set the Instant Pot to sauteé. Remove the rosemary sprigs and cook until the sauce is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a bowl.
Slice the French rolls open and spread ½ tablespoon of butter over each side. Add ½ cup of beef to each sandwich.
Serve the sandwiches with the jus on the side for dipping.
Enjoy!
